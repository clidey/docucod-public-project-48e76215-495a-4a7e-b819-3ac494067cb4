- **Scroller Controls:** Manage the automatic scrolling behavior for a hands-free reading experience.
- **Overlays:** Informational and control layers that provide additional context or action options.

### What You Will Achieve:

- Identify each UI element at a glance.
- Learn how to interact efficiently with controls to customize your browsing.
- Understand how overlays support your journey without disrupting flow.

## 2. Using the Interface: Step-by-Step

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate and Use the Search Bar">
Start by finding the search bar at the top of the interface.

- Click inside the search input to activate it.
- Type your desired subreddit or keywords.
- Press `Enter` or click the search icon to fetch related Reddit posts.

**Expected Result:** The image grid below updates with posts matching your query.
</Step>

<Step title="Interact with the Image Grid">
Once content loads, you’ll see images representing Reddit posts arranged in a grid.

- Scroll through the images to preview posts visually.
- Click on any image to expand details or open the post in Reddit.

**Expected Result:** The selected post opens in an overlay or new tab depending on settings.
</Step>

<Step title="Adjust Scroller Controls">
Scroller controls typically sit near the bottom or side of the interface.

- Use the play/pause button to start or stop automatic scrolling.
- Adjust scrolling speed via sliders or predefined speed buttons.
- Toggle scrolling direction if supported (vertical/horizontal).

**Expected Result:** Your scroll behavior updates instantly, offering a tailored reading pace.
</Step>

<Step title="Use Overlays for Extra Info and Actions">
Overlays are context-sensitive layers that appear over the main view.

- Look for overlays that provide post metadata, NSFW warnings, or content filters.
- Interact with buttons in overlays to hide, report, or save content.
- Dismiss overlays by clicking outside or pressing close icons.

**Expected Result:** Overlays provide needed detail or control options without interrupting flow.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If any of these components do not appear as described, ensure your Scroll-It app is fully loaded and connected to Reddit. Refer to the 'First Run & Quick Validation' guide for troubleshooting.
