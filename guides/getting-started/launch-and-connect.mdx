## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Launch the Scroll-It Application
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the Scroll-It project directory.
3. Start the development server using the command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

(replace with `npm run dev`, `pnpm dev`, or `bun dev` depending on your package manager)

4. Once started, open your web browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

**Expected Result:** The Scroll-It app loads with the main interface ready for input.

---

### Step 2: Enter a Reddit Thread URL
1. Locate the input field or interface element prompting you to enter a Reddit thread URL.
2. Enter a full Reddit thread URL. For example:

```
https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/abc123/example_thread/
```

3. Submit the URL by pressing Enter or clicking the associated button.

**Expected Result:** Scroll-It connects to the specified Reddit thread and begins loading content.

**Tip:** Use threads rich with images to maximize the app’s visual and scrolling benefits.

---

### Step 3: Activate the Auto-Scroller
1. Find the control or toggle labeled "Auto-Scroller" or similar.
2. Click or switch it on to start the automatic smooth scrolling.

**Expected Result:** The content begins to scroll automatically, bringing new images into view as you watch.

**Decision Point:** If auto-scrolling is too fast or slow, consider later customizing scroll speed via the settings (covered in advanced guides).

---

### Step 4: Enjoy Images Rendered and Scrolled Automatically
- Watch images load dynamically in your feed as the auto-scroller moves through the thread.
- Scroll-It renders images inline to provide an immersive browsing experience without manual scrolling.

**Expected Result:** A hands-free Reddit thread browsing experience with images appearing smoothly as you progress.

## Practical Examples

Here is a typical user flow example you can try immediately:

```plaintext
User launches Scroll-It at http://localhost:3000
User inputs "https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/xyz789/cute_puppy_pictures/"
User activates the auto-scroller toggle
User watches the app scroll automatically through image thumbnails and full images until reaching the end
```

This example illustrates how Scroll-It transforms Reddit browsing into an effortless slideshow of images.
