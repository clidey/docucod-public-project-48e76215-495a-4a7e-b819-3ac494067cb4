# Installation Guide for Scroll-It

This guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions to install Scroll-It on your machine. Follow these instructions to clone the repository, install dependencies, and set up your development environment, tailored for different platforms where applicable.

---

## 1. Prerequisites
Before installing Scroll-It, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.14 or later, or a recent Linux distribution
- **Node.js:** Version 16 or higher (recommended 18+). Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Package Manager:** npm (comes with Node.js), yarn, pnpm, or bun
- **Git:** Installed and accessible from your terminal/command prompt to clone the repository

<Tip>
Use `node -v`, `npm -v`, and `git --version` commands to verify your installations.
</Tip>

## 2. Clone the Scroll-It Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/modelorona/Scroll-It.git

# Change directory into the cloned folder
cd Scroll-It
```

<Tip>
If you encounter permission or SSL certificate errors during cloning, ensure that your Git configuration is correct or try cloning over SSH if you have access.
</Tip>

## 3. Install Dependencies
Scroll-It requires installing JavaScript dependencies managed via your chosen package manager.

### Choose your package manager:

| Package Manager | Install Command       |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| yarn            | `yarn install`       |
| npm             | `npm install`        |
| pnpm            | `pnpm install`       |
| bun             | `bun install`        |

### Run the install command inside the project directory:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn install

# or npm
npm install

# or pnpm
pnpm install

# or bun
bun install
```

<Check>
Ensure the installation process finishes without errors. If you see warnings related to JSON import, refer to the note below.
</Check>

<Note>
To suppress JSON import warnings during development:

- Add this to your environment before starting dev server: 
  - For Node <v21.3.0: `NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings'`
  - For Node >=v21.3.0: `NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'`

You can configure this in your package.json `dev` script for a seamless experience.
</Note>

## 4. Environment Setup
Scroll-It is primarily developed using Vue 3 and Vuetify 3 with TypeScript support. After installing dependencies, some environment variables or configuration edits may be needed depending on your workflow.

- The core plugins are automatically registered through `src/plugins/index.ts`.
- The entry point is `src/main.ts`, which bootstraps the app and mounts it on the `#app` element.

<Tip>
No manual editing is required here for a basic install â€” just make sure all dependencies are installed successfully.
</Tip>

## 5. Starting the Development Server
Once dependencies are installed, launch the development server to run Scroll-It locally.

```bash
# Example using yarn
yarn dev

# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm dev

# bun
bun run dev
```

The server will start at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), providing hot module replacement for fast, iterative development.

<Check>
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the Scroll-It main interface loading without errors.
</Check>

<Warning>
If the server does not start or throws errors:

- Confirm your Node.js version meets requirements
- Check for dependency issues in the terminal logs
- See the <a href="/getting-started/setup-prerequisites-installation/troubleshooting-install">Troubleshooting Installation</a> guide.
</Warning>

## 6. Building for Production
When ready to deploy, build an optimized production bundle:

```bash
# Yarn
yarn build

# npm
npm run build

# pnpm
pnpm build

# bun
bun run build
```

The compiled production files will be in the `dist/` folder, ready for hosting in your preferred environment.

## Troubleshooting Common Installation Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Common Installation Issues">
<Accordion title="Node.js version mismatch">
Ensure you have Node.js version 16+ installed:

```bash
node -v
```

If the version is below 16, download and install the latest LTS version from https://nodejs.org/.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Dependency installation errors">
Run the install command with verbose logging to find errors:

```bash
npm install --verbose
```

Check the network connectivity or proxy settings if packages fail to download.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Development server fails to start">
Confirm port 3000 is free and not used by another application.

Change the port in `vite.config.mts` under the `server.port` configuration if needed.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="JSON import warnings on startup">
Add the appropriate `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable to suppress these warnings during development as described above.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
