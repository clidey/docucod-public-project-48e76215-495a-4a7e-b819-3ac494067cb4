# Troubleshooting Installation

Ensure your Scroll-It installation is seamless by addressing common setup pitfalls promptly. This guide helps you identify and fix version mismatches, missing dependencies, and other frequent issues preventing a smooth installation.

---

## 1. Common Installation Issues and Solutions

### a. Node.js Version Mismatch

Scroll-It requires a compatible Node.js version to function correctly.

**How to check your Node.js version:**
```bash
node -v
```

**Recommended Version:**
- Use Node.js version 16.x or later for best compatibility.

**Solution if version is incompatible:**
- Upgrade or switch Node versions using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):

```bash
nvm install 18
nvm use 18
```

<Tip>
Using Node.js versions less than 16 can lead to build errors or runtime failures.
</Tip>

---

### b. Missing or Incomplete Dependencies

After cloning the repository, dependencies must be installed correctly.

**Verify installation:**
- Run the package manager's install command in the project root.

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install

# Using pnpm
pnpm install
```

If you encounter errors during installation:
- Delete the `node_modules` folder and the lock file (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) and run install again.
- Ensure you have network access and no firewall restrictions blocking package downloads.

<Tip>
For a clean slate, use:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
</Tip>

---

### c. Build Failures During Installation

Build problems often relate to incompatible environments or missing build tools.

**Key checks:**
- Ensure your system meets minimal requirements for Vite, Vue 3, and Vuetify.
- Ensure you have up-to-date compilers and build utilities.

**Common error example:**
- Errors referencing `esbuild` or TypeScript issues.

**How to fix:**
- Update your package manager to the latest version.
- Clean cache and try reinstalling:
  ```bash
  npm cache clean --force
  npm install
  ```
- Install missing build tools globally if applicable (e.g., `typescript` or `esbuild`).

<Warning>
Avoid skipping error messages during install; they often pinpoint missing dependencies or unsupported versions.
</Warning>

---

### d. Environment & Configuration Errors

Some setups require environment variables or config files.

**Scroll-It specific notes:**
- No special environment variables are needed for installation.
- Ensure your project config files (e.g., `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.mts`) remain unaltered unless explicitly required.

<Tip>
If you modified config files and encounter errors, try reverting to the original version.
</Tip>

---

## 2. Verifying Installation Success

After installation, verify the application launches correctly:

### Starting the Development Server

Run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Check output for messages like:
```
  VITE vX.Y.Z  ready in XXXX ms
  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Expected Behavior
- The Scroll-It UI should load displaying main interface without error messages.

If you encounter runtime errors:
- Review console logs for missing components or failed imports.
- Check browser dev tools for any network or JavaScript errors.

## 3. Troubleshooting Tips

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Tips">
<Accordion title="Dependency Conflicts">
If you observe version conflicts or peer dependency warnings, consider using `pnpm` or forcing resolutions in `package.json`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Dynamic Import Errors">
Some dynamic import errors may occur. These are usually resolved by refreshing the page once. If persistent, try clearing cache and local storage.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Port Conflicts">
If port 3000 is in use, specify a different port in `vite.config.mts` under the `server.port` setting.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Permission Issues on Unix Systems">
Use `sudo` cautiously. Prefer fixing user permissions or using Node Version Manager (nvm) to avoid permission errors.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 4. When to Seek Help

If you have exhausted the troubleshooting steps:
- Visit the official [Vuetify Documentation](https://vuetifyjs.com/) for dependency issues.
- Check Vite and Vue GitHub issues for compatibility problems.
- Refer to your package manager’s troubleshooting guides (npm, yarn, pnpm).
- Review open issues or report new ones at the [Scroll-It GitHub repository](https://github.com/modelorona/Scroll-It/issues).

<Tip>
Include detailed error logs and system info when requesting support to expedite problem resolution.
</Tip>

## Quick Reference Table of Common Issues

| Issue                  | Cause                               | Solution                            |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Node.js Version        | Too old or incompatible Node.js    | Upgrade Node.js >=16 via nvm     |
| Dependencies Missing   | Interrupted or incomplete install  | Delete node_modules and reinstall |
| Build Errors           | Missing build tools/versions       | Clear cache, update tools, reinstall |
| Dynamic Import Errors  | Caching or partial reload issues  | Refresh page, clear cache/localStorage |
| Port In Use            | 3000 port conflict                 | Change port in vite.config.mts    |

## Example: Clearing Cache and Reinstalling Dependencies

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
npm run dev
```

This restores a clean installation state and often resolves dependency or build failures.
