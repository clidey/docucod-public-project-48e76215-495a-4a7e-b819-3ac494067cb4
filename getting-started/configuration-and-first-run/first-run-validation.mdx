# First Run & Quick Validation

Welcome to your first experience with Scroll-It. This guide walks you through launching the application, accessing the web interface, and performing quick validation to confirm the auto-scroll feature on Reddit image threads is functioning correctly.

---

## 1. Launching Scroll-It for the First Time

Getting started with Scroll-It is seamless once your environment is set based on the previous configuration and installation steps.

### Step 1: Start the Scroll-It Application

- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to your project directory where Scroll-It is installed.
- Run the development server using your package manager, for example:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn dev

# Or using npm
npm run dev
```

- Wait for the console message confirming the server is running. You should see an output similar to:

```
Listening on http://localhost:3000
```

<Tip>
If you encounter JSON import warnings, consider setting the environment variable:

`NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings'` 

or, for Node v21.3.0 and above, 

`NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'`.
</Tip>

### Step 2: Access the Web Interface

- Open your preferred web browser.
- Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- The Scroll-It interface will load within the Vuetify framework, featuring a clean, responsive design ready for use.

<Note>
Ensure that your firewall or network settings allow connections to port 3000.
</Note>

## 2. Quick Validation Checks

Once the UI loads, follow these steps to confirm Scroll-It’s core functionality.

### Step 1: Load a Reddit Image Thread

- In the web interface, navigate or provide the URL of a Reddit thread containing images that you want to auto-scroll.
- Confirm the page loads the thread images correctly.

### Step 2: Enable Auto-Scroll

- Activate the auto-scroll feature using the interface toggle or button available on the main page.
- The viewport should start scrolling smoothly through the images without manual intervention.

<Check>
Observe continuous, seamless scrolling behavior flowing through images in the thread.
</Check>

### Step 3: Validate Scroll Behavior

- Try pausing and restarting the scrolling.
- Adjust any speed settings if available (refer to advanced guides).
- Confirm scrolling resumes accurately and without stutter.

### Step 4: Monitor Console for Errors

- Open your browser’s developer console (F12 or Cmd+Opt+I).
- Verify there are no runtime errors or warnings related to dynamic imports or scripting failures.

<Warning>
If errors appear regarding failed module imports, try refreshing the page. Scroll-It includes a retry mechanism that reloads the page to fix dynamic import errors automatically.
</Warning>

## 3. Practical Tips for First Run Success

- **Browser Compatibility:** Use modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge for optimal functioning.
- **Network Access:** Ensure uninterrupted internet access for Reddit threads to load correctly.
- **Performance:** For best performance, use on machines meeting standard development specifications (refer to System Requirements).

<Tip>
If auto-scroll does not start automatically, confirm the auto-scroll toggle is activated in the UI.
</Tip>

## 4. Troubleshooting Common First Run Issues

<Accordion title="Page Does Not Load at http://localhost:3000">
- Verify the development server is running without errors.
- Confirm you ran `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` in the correct directory.
- Check that port 3000 is not blocked or used by another application.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Auto-Scroll Fails to Activate or Stalls">
- Refresh the web page to reset the app state.
- Check for console errors related to loading scripts or scrolling logic.
- Ensure you have loaded a valid Reddit image thread URL.
- Refer to advanced configuration to adjust scrolling parameters.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Dynamic Import Errors in Console">
- Scroll-It automatically attempts a page reload when detecting dynamic import errors.
- If errors persist after reload, clear localStorage for the site and try again.
</Accordion>

## 5. What’s Next?
